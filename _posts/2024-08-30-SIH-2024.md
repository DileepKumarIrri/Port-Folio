Through the SAP 2024, the Department aims to institutionalize Swachhta protocols across the network with local ownership and adherence to basic standards. To ensure the outcome the solution to the Problem Statement may be useful for the Department to meet its objectives across the network. In addition to the Swachhta Action Plan and related behaviours and practices, the Department is also committed to adopt Lifestyle for Environment Practices for each of its administrative and operative units. Monitoring system for LiFE with modern and emerging technologies is also welcome to make the Swachhta focused solution above even more useful and powerful for the Department. Description: This is a problem statement seeking monitoring and data analytics solution using modern and emerging Industry 4.0 technologies. While the use of AI and pictorial data based automated monitoring is at the heart of the problem, the team working on this problem can choose any combination of available technologies and tools to devise a simple to use and adopt solution to enable its mass adoption across the post office network. Expected Solution: The expected solution is pictorial data and analytics based on AI. Cameras to capture pictorial data are available in various locations in the DoP and actual or dummy data for the solution will be provided. The geolocation and timestamp on the pictorial data is also to be taken as a fundamental data point to capture in the spirit of the outcome expected towards improved internal governance of Swachhta and green, LiFE, practices being adopted by the Department. The solution developed here could have a wide application based on the scalability that is built in by the teams working on this problem statement.
